Bid for SGN and never get it at all!,1

I don’t bid for trips because I can’t do them. Roaster must account for this. Some people  are unable to leave home for that long.,1
"I dont bid for much, so I would hope I would achieve at least my days off- especially at this time of year when people have events and family commitments. I have had to swap to ensure I cant attend the things I have committed to (eg. My cousins grad)",0
"I don't get my buddy bid even though have bid before deadline, the system say ""There's no buddy bid"".",1

I have 3 wide open bids with heaps of flying possibilities including4 sector days and I only received 1day matching my 3 bids,4
I kept my bid for November very simple bidding for only Singapore trips and only got one. This clearly shows Jbids is not working.,3

I nodded for mornings and I gots lots of Bali’s which finish late the next day. They aren’t a early shift,0
I nominated days and got nothing?,3
I only bid for duties signing on between 0500-0800 or signing off between 11:30-14:30 yet only received 5 and a mix for all other duties. This is too difficult for 1 person to have to work when it’s all hours of the clock week to week.,0
I only bid for earlies nothin else and have been getting them up until this month,1
I only bid for layover in Mel but didn’t get any,1
I only got 40% of my bids. I try and keep my bids simple to achieve satisfaction but getting less than half of what I bid for is very disappointing.,4

I only got one out of my many continuous simple bids,3
I only received 5 shifts and 3 out of 5 not what I bid for,1
"I placed only one bid, highest priority and I didn't get it.",1

I received 1 of the 2 days I had asked for off this month.,0

"I request late standbys, 1st day back from leave 3am stby, following day late shift.",0
I requested 4 consecutive days off at the end the month - something I have been consistently doing every month all year and previously it has been granted every month…NOT for November though because of the new rule of you removing single days off.,0
"I requested for 4 days off, I’ve got 4 AVLs instead",3
I was granted a week of leave that was not put on my roster so I had to contact my manager to get the shifts removed,0
I was rostered zero shifts even though I nominated to work.,0

I’ve been bidding for trips for the past few months and I’ve gotten 0,0
I’ve given up on bids,4
"Im late prefer and I get lots of morning, this is not good",0
It is the worst roster I have had since returning to Narrow Body,0
its hard to get what I bid of,1
It's not what I bid for at all so pretty unhappy. I bid for 2 sectors and I got mostly 4 sectors.,1
"Jbid has not worked for so many people over so many months  What’s the point of asking for days off and not getting them , you might as well not request them",0
Jnis is useless for CMs.,0
Keep getting rostered shifts that are not within my bids. Morning preferred and rostered lates. 2 out of 5 day off requests granted.,0
Literally bid for 2 days off. No dice as usual.,0
Minimum bidding satisfaction achieved as most duties are opposite to what was requested and day off requests rendered pointless as the string of days off are broken up with duties. An early standby followed by an afternoon duty - OFF day plans ruined,2
"Months ago requested highest priority 2 days together and rostered GT4 on 2nd day on unpublished, emailed training to change and no reply. Highest priority 2 days before holiday and didn’t get. Also rostered morning domestic AVL and PM preference.",4
My bids have not changed since June last year  For some reason this month all I got were 5am sign ons,3
my days of were achieved but not my duty bid and it always seems like one or the other when it comes to the bids,2
My highest bid for trips continues to not be met,1
My highest bid of a day off was not achieved,2
My highest bid of a weekend off I didn’t get. Too many day shifts and not enough trips,1
"My highest bid was a day off however I was rostered x4 AVLs with the last one being on the day I bidded to have off, making it extremely difficult to adjust. I also bidded for early duties however received many lates instead.",1
My highest bid was for trips and I did not get a single one.,1
My preference is late and I got early and BOC??  Some crew preference BOC but didn't get any or early crew got some late shifts which is they can't do.,3
My request for SIN was allocated then changed by WFP on publication.,0
Negative satisfaction as cabin crew we rely on consistency and reliability. Unfortunately JBid is continually falling short.,0
Never get days off requests fulfilled and so hard to swap out of duties. The Pairings are fatiguing and BNE needs more trips for those who want them to break it up abit,0
Never got one,3
Never got what i have bid for,3

Not one bid granted,1
Not satisfied at all,0
Not satisfied at all.,0
"October, I requested AM duties and was given AM duties.  November JBid preferences remained exactly the same as October and for November  I’m rostered all Late duties. It is clear that Adhoc CM’s destroy permanent CM roster requests.",0
"Once again I am getting the opposite to what I bid for, even after following the advice from the Jbid experts",1
"One out of four bids, making it very hard to have any life outside of work  what so ever.",4
"Only achieved 4 out of all my bids, not many trips were given considering I mainly bidded for trips, too many 4 sectors and an avalon duty when Tullamarine is my preferred base.",2
Only one duty that fell within my bid parameters,1
Perth balisr eturns  with little rests in between causes fatigue.,0
"Priority bids all ignored,",4
Received 0 duties that represent my highest bid,1
Received all 4 sector days when I specifically requested 2 sectors,0
Requested 1 day off on a week day a been sent on a trip.,0

"Requests not allocated, three trips with 0 requested, all early standbys with PM set as preference. Two 3am standbys directly before simulator",0
Rostered 13 afterrnoon duties as mornings preferred and more long 4 sectors than usual,0
Sad,0
Same as above example,0
"Same as the above answer, this months worse than last month with non preferred.",0
Same statement as above Highest none was achieved?? thought that at least bidding for highest was a priority so that crew can arrange their work life balance.,2
"See previous comment. Ideal shifts, but receiving less and less duties each month is consistently disappointing",0
Single day off,0
Taken all preferences out and only requested 3 days off and for one of the single days off I'm sent to another base for 4 days. Not a great product,0
Terrible I only bit for mornings and have been given lates. I understand there are a lot of people but this is the only thing I bit for and I would like to have that.,0
Terrible. As above. The single trip I have been rostered is in my option a fatigue risk. I have requested a roster review from the RFM,0
"The bid didn't match even a single one. I bid several but it was one certain flight, didn't get one.",1
The days off I bided for were complete ignored. It’s totally unacceptable.,4
The outcome is totally opposite of my bidding.,0
This system is not working didn’t get my requests,0
Three HIGHEST REQUESTS. Again 3 HIGHEST requests of a Sunday Monday off have not been achieved. What a waste of highest bids and a waste of my time bidding. What’s the point of bidding when the roster I have looks like someone that hasn’t bid,2
too many 4 sectors and not within desired finish timeframe,0
"Too many requests denied, especially days off",0
Trainers cannot bid.,1
Trip bids set up for many preferences but none satisfied,4
Unhappy,0
Unmet bids,4
Very disappointed.  I only got 1 requested Dey off got the month and it is my highest request.,3
Very unsatisfied because I don’t get what I ask for. Jbid keeps disappointing and no surprises also. Expert advise doesn’t help.,0
Waste of time as usual,0
We were getting blocks of days off that worked well.,0
"Well I got my requested 2 days off, but then I got 2 x 5am early shifts after it which doesn’t make sense as I am PM preferred as Global preference…",3
What I have is all ICN I am a Japanese speaker tho,0
"What is the point of having a bid system if it clearly fails to deliver what it promises, or alludes to promising? You bid lates, you get earlies. It is a complete waste of time.",1
"While I bid for trips, to try to mitigate fatigue,  it now looks like trips are being paired to become  fatigue enducing.",1
Why is there any bid for day off if my bid is not granted at all? I am very disappointed with this month roster.,1
Worst Roster,0
Zero bid outcomes achieved. Outcomes emailed to baseops with no follow-up to date.,2
Zero bids achieved again,2
