Roster Remarks

☹️☹️☹️☹️
0 bids achieved
0 of my highest day of bids were met. Two single off days
2 trips and I ask for early 2 sector days. I am a primary carere
2 wks of lates and they're all long 4 sectors!!! Where are the late crew. Jbids doesn't work for CM.
25 words? 25 characters!!
3 out of 5 of my bids were all exact opposite of by bids
3 sectors BNE SYD BNE PER is very fatiguing due duty length.
4 sector duties when I asked for 2
4 trips rostered  I bid for 2-4 afternoon sectors Am stbys .. bid for PM's
A lot of paxxing
A minimum day off home base must be considered before starting another set of long duty
"Absolutely disgusting, early to late transitions, BOC, why are all my days off on a Tuesday/wednesday?! One of the worst rosters I’ve seen yet."
"Absolutely terrible, pairings with big breaks, blocks of 4 early’s in a row with stb where if I get used the stb on day 4 isn’t useable with FRMS"
AI totally not following my instruction  l only wanted short early start end by 1100am it gave me trip and mix
All early shift.  I bid for late
"All of my Highest bid was 0 achieved and my High Medium Low bids which fell into these category only 3 was achieved. So technically my Highest was a waste of bids, not one was achieved where I could have used it for other purposes."
Always have the same bid every month & always only get the high preferred instead of my highest. Very disappointing however greatful to have a working roster
Annoying survey
"As expected. Not good, not bad."
"As international long haul crew such as SEQ Base, we recently have too many back to back flights, 3 or even 4 3day trip in a row. It causes physically and mentally fatigue.  If the roster creates a long trip, it should not roster 3 or 4 back-to-back."
Ask for lates only and continue to get early shifts mixed in with my lates
Asked for a specific day off and instead was rostered a 5 day trip. Makes it harder to swap out of. I dont bid for trips yet I keep getting rostered them.
AVL was waaayyy to much with that 6 in a row.
back to back balis are fatiguing
"Being part time I prefer all my duties together and BLN, OFF, and LVE days together, not rostered duty/ies in the middle"
Bid for all night shifts gave me a 3am avls.
"Bid for single-day duties, received 5 trips."
"Bid is for two sectors post 6am, no overnights and PM a standby. Roster is opposite of this with many 5am shifts and 3am standby"
Bidded for only trips and only received 1 the rest 4 sectors
buddy system not work
Could be better I have pms as preferred and getting ams can be difficult to over come.
Crammed all my flying after coming off annual leave
Crew should get varieties of trip not only Hnl
"Day off requests broken up, some granted and 2 middle days not granted rendering the time requested off as useless and unusable for what I wanted to do with family. Thanks!"
Days off I request didn’t get  Flight I request didn’t get  Am and got a boc
Days off request denied.
"Did not achieve my bid preferences, and received a mixed roster with no structure or order"
Did not get any of my bids
Didint get 5am sign ons- didnt get days off
Didn’t get the days off I bud for
didn't get with in my sign off times
Didn't receive my afternoon bid even though it was my highest bid.
Disgusting
"domestic duties have become even longer eg DUD ZQN, Double CHC, and duties are signing off more regularly on the same day as the start of another duty."
Don’t get trip which I really wanted.
Don’t get what I requested at all
Don't like 4+ days of 4 sectors in a row. Didn't get the days off I needed
Early starts into late finish before days off. A run of duties should not change between early and late.
Far too many trips away
Flying back to back Phuket makes me stressful. I prefer long trip and stying out port 10-14 days please.
Four sectors are all lumped together and then I switch to earlies
Giving me 3 AVLs before my 3weeks leave is cruel :(
Going from afternoons to mornings to BOC how can one not be fatigued with this kind of rostering
Going from mornings to BOC then back to mornings and afternoons. How fatiguing.
Good 2(+) day spacing between duties
"Good spread of work , would like more than one day off between trips."
Got no work??
Happy for one way JQ90 should be rostered this WAY always should  not be a return !!!
happy with day off requests
"Have been bidding for a Singapore trip for months, as well as DPS and other trips"
Hello Fatigue - goodbye rest. My October roster was a dream compared to this. Swapping has improved it somewhat.
HNL
Horrible. Did not receive any of my bids yet again. Very upset.
I always wanted to go to Japan as it is my only destination that I wanted to go and I always keep bidding for it but I never got it at all.
I am a morning person and I do not appreciate being placed on later shifts as a full timer. It is not healthy or safe to be changing anyone that is on mornings to lates. This is the one thing I bit for and I find it very upsetting I can’t have that
I am an AM 5-8 or 9-12 start I got THREE BOC. I WILL NOT DO BOC I cannot sleep during day I cannot stay awake all night I am not safe to operate that is why I would never bid for them I know my limitations. Morning or afternoons only.
I am earlies preferred and have been given late shifts and a BOC coverage which I will be called out for. Also 7 AVL
I am n international crew and being rostered huge sectors of domestic
"I am unhappy with the constant changes from morning, afternoon, back to morning, afternoon shifts"
I am usually rostered earlies and for all arvo and lates
I ask for trips
"I asked for ONE day off as my highest preference, and instead of it, l was given the following two days off. Really?!"
"I bid for a specific trip out of Sydney , JQ141 and did not receive any."
"I bid for AM shifts, and got PM shifts, I bid for single day trips, I got overnight trips"
I bid for lates and I continually get rostered mornings (8 in fact).  I also only got 1 requested day off for the month and it is my highest bid
"I bid for mornings, and all I got was 1 morning stby"
I bid for NO overnights and have 11 nights away!!! Explain how that works
I did not even get any 9 days trip.
I did not get any trips when I bid for layovers. What’s the point in bidding for trips when I’m trips preferred and I don’t even get my preferences
I didn’t get that many shifts
I didn’t get what I asked for.
i didnt even get 1 of my bidded destination or go to one destination with my buddy
I don’t bid for lates or 4 sectors. 50% lates and 4 sectors!
I don’t have any trip that I requested
I go from BOCs to 5am sign ons multiple times
I got mostly domestic flights. Would appreciate a few Tasman flights
"I got no shifts for the month of November, I’m from 5/2 casual ground school and have wanted full time, since staring, but since I’ve started lots of full time gs have come thru without any offerings for existing staff for full time work."
I got several late duties and overnights when I bid for early. Also late standby when requesting early
I got zero requests
I have leave so that helps  Some late shifts that I only ask for early morning sign on s
I have not been rostered any duties the past 4 months
I like that my roster has no paxing after duty.
I prefer long day off or slip day in between like other crew base.
I request late starts. I have morning shifts. I also request shifts that finish before 12am to avoid BOC. I got 2 rostered plus avl for BOC so potential for 2 BOC in a row. High risk for fatigue and my safety
I requested a range of days off and I was given two of those requests . Every weekend and single days odd
I still have paxing after flight which is exhausting and tiring. Do better
I want a long trip. Like we used to have it and not a 2 days or 3 days trip and back home on repeat mode. 10 or 12 days then off
I was rostered afternoons and bocs that I don't ask for.
I was rostered zero shifts even though I nominated to work.
I would love to try other destination because this november all i got is only MEL flight
"I’m a mum, with requests in. I’m working 5am-3pm most shifts. Which are not my requests."
I'm early preferred and I was only allocated 1 early duty and the rest lates. My highest priority is Pairing of total length 1 days which should lessen my chance of being rostered a Boc but still been rostered a Boc.
I'm on annual leave for the majority of the month.
Incorrectly rostered without mandatory 7 days free of duty whilst on Flexiline. How does this even happen???
"It was getting better, now I have a 6 day trip I didn’t ask for."
It’s deflating to see and fatiguing to manage when there’s no routine even when only having 3 bids for types of duties. Extremely disappointing
its good for crew rest. theres still paxing after work but theres improvemnet
its probably the worst roster I've received in a while especially being part time
its so hard to work some days in morning n then some days in the noon. There should be uniformity.
Japanese speaker did not roster to Japan at all
"JBID doesn't do anything for me, always 0 0 0 0 0 roster achievement, very very disappointing."
JBid is useless.
Just so many Bali's when not bidding for them. No work life balance
Keep getting earlies
Lack of duties
"Lates into earlys, fatiguing, poorly structured. Minimal rest"
Less day off between the trips or during the trips
Literally got zero shifts apart from EPs
Lots of early to late transitions
Lots of late duties which I do not bid for
Mainly leave but still not one bid granted
"Many early to lates and lates to early transition, single days off, too many avls and of a mix of time."
Morning preferred and rostered mixture of earlies going into lates with single day offs.
Mornings one week to afternoons than to mornings and than back to afternoons affects the sleep schedule
Mostly 4 sectors backed up in a row or AVL/ big duties like AKL and BOCs. Not spread out or split up nicely.
Mostly mornings and trips away
My highest bid was for trips and I did not get a single one.
My preference is late but I have got early and BOC??  A lot of crew who prefer early got late ??
My roster is basically sin-mel-sin or sin-per-sin. I wont earn enough from a roster like this. How am i suppose to survive in Sin like this. Not even layovers in SGN or NRT or KIX or ICN. My roster has been like this for 4 or 5 months???
Never been so disappointed. Late s instead of earlies.
No duties received.
"No requested bids, no blocks of off days, min rest duties"
No requests
"No shifts at all, not happy."
No variety. No DPS and too many AKL. Need to bring back the option of max number of times a bid is successful
Not at all!
Not bad… no swapping from lates to early shifts
Not enough shifts
Not flying in my home base
not getting bids
Not getting days off wanted. Not getting the type of flying I bid for.
"Not getting shift bids, FWs causing unfair roster."
Not happy
Not many hours
Not satisfied as I wanted trips and only got 3 trips for the month.
Not satisfied. Too inefficient even for flexi. Makes swapping shifts to make up for the poor rostering almost impossible.
Not very it’s all over the shops very fatiguing roster between early plates and BOCs
Not what I bid for
Nothing come up on my request trips
November roster does not match biddings
Off days are too short with avl between off
On leave
"Only 1 787 flight. Domestic CMs get more trip than I do and I am an international crew. All the other LFs have 0-1 AVL, I have 4. Financially challenging and really unfair."
"Only 1 duty met my bid parameters, the rest were the complete opposite."
Only ask for sign off times and still get split days with a boc
Only bidded for 2 days off & rostered to work both. It looks very spiteful as 1 of those days I have days off either side.
Only had one bid and didnt even get it
"Overall the duties given were ideal, however only getting 5 duties in a month of full availability is extremely disappointing"
Pax flight to cns x3
Poor bid satisfaction.
"Received 4 BOCS that I didn’t request and all on weekends, part time and hardly getting weekday shifts, roster is all over the place"
"Requested AM 2 sectors and got lots 4 sector afternoons, a BOC and a BOC standby."
Requested KIX flight the most but only one I have
roster has no variations for the last 3 months. doing short turn affect salary and livelihoods as it does not pay bills.
Roster is not diversity.
Roster not consistent with bids
"Rostered 6 days in a row, including 3 earlys a BOC and finishing with a 4 sector late duty. Not sure how it fits in with fatigue management."
Same old same
Seems silly rostering Adhoc CM’s 10 AVL’s when those AVL’s should be rostered to Permanent Part timers who request the work.  This is simply unfair and not looking after permanent CM’s.
Seems to be getting worse.
"Since March my roster has been amazing, but this month is completely off."
"Single day off after a BOC, then on to an early the next day. Single day off between 2x4 day trips, where I targeted single duty days this month."
"Single days off, long duties after trips"
Single off
So many duties past midnight and in a row making it’s so hard to even swap shifts
Still getting lates that I never bid for
Structure? I didn't get enough shifts to pay rent
"Terrible, standby before Sim. Single Days off, no trip requests granted that I was wanting. 1 month of duties in 20 days, poorly executed roster."
The month of October was better but i did bid for trips for this month and didn’t get any
The roster format is not easy to read. The lay out should be as easy to read as the pairing reports. Easy to locate fly hours for day and also our daily duties hours should be visible for each day.  Keeping this hidden from crew is sneaky.
"The trip is too long until 12 days, it's to tiring and prone to fatigue."
There is a mixture of earlies and lates and BOC in the same week.
"There is pattern per - sin - dps - bne, which is can possibly lead to fatigue"
"This arranged roster will lead to fatigue issue as you planned the minimum rest in each day. Some days are the day rest, which is difficult to manage proper sleep. Pease do not roster paxing flight before or after duty as it will disrupt next duty."
This rosters pairings looks to be extremely fatiguing.
"Thought JBID was getting better, I was wrong back to square 1. Not getting what you ask for"
"too many 4 sectors, only half a BOC"
Too many AVL for this month.
Too many AVL’s
Too many consecutive days of standby
"Too many long 10+ hour days, looks fatiguing"
Too many long shifts in. Row.
Too many paxing flights after landing
Too many short trips
Totally dissatisfied. Received none of my bids and have received shifts completely opposite to what I bid for. I big for morning two sectors and have received all trips and late 4 sectors.
"totally insane, I’ll make a report about this"
"Totally opposite to what I bid for! Morning shifts with NO overnights. My roster for this month is ALL trips away, afternoon shifts and only 1 flight out of my actual base. Could not be more dissatisfied!"
Training planning is good. Rostering avls in the AM is not. There is nothing plenty of am crew that can be used for that coverage. My pm avl preference has been ignored.
Trgs take half of the mth
Two 5day trips while FTCL
Two thirds of my roster is lates when I have a preference for earlies.
Unmet bids
Unreasonable parings
"Very busy first 2 weeks and a lot of days off the second 2 weeks, the workload could be more even and spread out. Fatigue: 2 X 4 sector days at the end of a run of 5 days & Perth duties now begin with a SYD return."
Very little shifts once again given
Wanted mornings as priority
Why are we still doing tag flights? They are very much fatigue inducing.
"Worst roster I've had in years. Want early day trips, got 4 trips and only 3 earlies."
