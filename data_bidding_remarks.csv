Bidding Remarks

0 achieve for NRT and there is no much combination
0 achieved  - disappointing
0 bidding flight ☹️☹️
0 bids awarded
0 of my biggest off day bids were met. two single of days
0 standing preferences achieved
0245 and 0300 avls were rostered when I’ve made it VERY CLEAR that my preference is pm avls since 2019 - there is plenty of options to roster me avls after 0900 there is also minimum 5 crew who got no shifts that could b used for am avls over me
"1 morning stby was the only bid I achieved, arvo duties with young kids is fatiguing at best. How do I go from being given mostly what I bid for in August to nothing in November weigh no change in my bids??????"
2 highest bids are trips but did not receive any
2 trips and I ask for early 2 sector days. I am a primary carere
25 words? 25 characters!!
4 of my bids were for trips and I’ve only got one trip.
A mixture of short two sectors and long four sectors. Majority four sectors.
Absolutely nothing what I bid for. CANNOT get any days off or any bids for that matter!
"Absolutely terrible, I got 0 bid satisfaction. It’s pathetic when we live by a roster getting day off bids are critical."
Achieved 0
Achieved zero bids
"Again, received 0 of my preferences and have been allocated shifts opposite to what I bid for."
All I request is Saigon and I received one. Everyone on the FO chat doesn’t request saigons and they have 2 or 3 each.
Although I got my day off requests. The time and effort I had to put in with trying to swap is relentless.
Always never get any bids except for days off  But good enough
Am prefer and got more lates
As above
"As preference for dps trips only one was adhered to. Didn’t get the only one highest bid for 2 day off satisfaction, boc standbys and afternoons rostered when mornings preference."
"Ask for early mornings & no overnights, I get late's & overnights"
Asked for (1) day off in highest and high and still didn’t get it off
Asked for afternoon shifts and got mornings or BOCs
Asked for cairns got Honolulu (like always)
Barely got any of my bids.
Bid for AMs rostered all PMs
Bid for min time over nights.
Bid for mornings get majority lates. No balance of 2 sectors between morning shifts and lates causing all crew wanting a shifts. Pairings need balance to fix rosters
"Bid for mornings, get too many lates."
Bid for PM standbys and got 3 AM ones; multiple shifts outside my bidding hours requests
Bid for SGN and never get it at all!
Bid for two trips. Did not receive either. Bid for a specific 7 day off bloc. Did not receive it. Please explain the hierarchy of bid allocations - from what I can see it is done on an alphabetical allocation of surname which would be completely ludi
Bidded for mornings and got evenings
buddy system not work
Days off request denied
Did not get any bidding dessination
Did not get any overnights
Didn’t get a trip
Didn’t get any preference  flights at all
Didn’t get any trips and got 4 BOCS.
Didn’t get any trips I bidded for
Didn’t get the days off I bid for
"Didn’t receive what I bidded for, I have asked for layovers the last couple of months and received none"
Didn't bid for anything last month but this month I did & got nothing but STAR days which was used so I could have a weekend off as haven't had one for over 2 months
Didnt get ANY day off requests!
"didn't get any trip Request , this is 3rd month in row"
"didn't get with in my sign off times, and no trips"
Didn't receive my afternoon bid even though it was my highest bid.
Doesn’t seem to work everytime.
Don’t understand how I’m rostered BOCS/LATES/MORNINGS when I bidded for mornings and overnights. Major fatigue risk
Expect sick leave and when ran out  Very excited to take up pay cut as full-timer
"Flight request not fulfilled, only Day Off this time"
"FT cm should get preference before adhoc, they are adhoc to fill the roster gaps."
"Got 0 bids approved, i donot understand what's the point of bidding if they not gonna get through."
Got first priority bid for days off at beginning of month but no regard for preferred pairings beyond that bid for entire month. Unsatisfied
Got very little bids
Got Zero of my day off requests. Worst roster
Gotten worse I don't want trips Am stbys  Do better
haven bid anything yet
Highest bid achieved nothing from previous 75+% strike rate in previous rosters. No 2 sectors tasmans at all
Highest priority bid was once again ignored
Highest priority was mornings and single day pairings. I’ve got afternoons and trips
HKT
I ask for trips
"I asked for ONE day off as my highest pref, and instead l was given the following two days off. I bid for 2 sectors and got so many 4's, not just a few but at least 40% of my roster. Finally, my AVL's are pm, but l was given a 3:00am AVL. Really?!"
I bid for bocs I don’t get them I have to swap most of my shifts
I bid for buddy flying but the bid somehow doesn’t recorded and it says “no buddy bid”
I bid for early starts 0500-0830 and have mostly late duties
I bid for late 2 sectors. Got mostly 4 sectors and a couple earlies.
I bid for lates. I got morning shifts.
i bid for mornings and got lates
I bid for really shifts and get late shifts
I did not get any of trips that I bid.
I did not receive the trip as requested.
I didn’t get any trips and I got 5am starts when I bid for pm sign ons
I didn’t get my bid and I have to go through a long list to find my paring in order to know which I can bid.
I didn’t get the bids I asked for
I didn't bid for trips and got them
I didn't get my bidding.
I do not get the outcome I bid for period
I do not want early shifts and got 6
I don’t bid for lates or 4 sectors. I received 50% lates and 4 sectors!  There is literally 1 shift on my roster which corresponds to my preference/ bids. Def zero improvement
I don’t bid for trips because I can’t do them. Roaster must account for this. Some people  are unable to leave home for that long.
"I dont bid for much, so I would hope I would achieve at least my days off- especially at this time of year when people have events and family commitments. I have had to swap to ensure I cant attend the things I have committed to (eg. My cousins grad)"
"I don't get my buddy bid even though have bid before deadline, the system say ""There's no buddy bid""."
I don't get the bidding that I request and my buddy flying isn't working for a long period now. This situation is causing significant inconvenience and dissatisfaction as I had hoped to travel with my partner.
I don't want trips.
i got no shifts why would i be happy
"I got Zero achieved bids for my Nov Roster which is a huge disappointment. None of my ‘Highest’ or ‘High’ bids were achieved. Nor any Medium, Low or Lowest. I had 11 bids in and didn’t achieve any."
I have 3 wide open bids with heaps of flying possibilities including4 sector days and I only received 1day matching my 3 bids
I kept my bid for November very simple bidding for only Singapore trips and only got one. This clearly shows Jbids is not working.
"I never request a weekend off, I did the first to attend a wedding. I didn’t get it off."
I nodded for mornings and I gots lots of Bali’s which finish late the next day. They aren’t a early shift
I nominated days and got nothing?
I only bid for duties signing on between 0500-0800 or signing off between 11:30-14:30 yet only received 5 and a mix for all other duties. This is too difficult for 1 person to have to work when it’s all hours of the clock week to week.
I only bid for earlies nothin else and have been getting them up until this month
I only bid for layover in Mel but didn’t get any
I only got 40% of my bids. I try and keep my bids simple to achieve satisfaction but getting less than half of what I bid for is very disappointing.
"I only got one day off that I bid, but none of the destinations that I bid for. Only ICN flight that I bid and I still have not gotten it."
I only got one out of my many continuous simple bids
I only received 5 shifts and 3 out of 5 not what I bid for
"I placed only one bid, highest priority and I didn't get it."
"I prefer 2 long sector in arvo, I have rostered for 2 short sectors. I do aware that im casual, but Full time crew wont be able to do 5 perth in a row anyways, its just unrealistic roster for everyone…"
I prefer BOCs but still got early mornings
I received 1 of the 2 days I had asked for off this month.
I received the opposite
"I request late standbys, 1st day back from leave 3am stby, following day late shift."
I requested 4 consecutive days off at the end the month - something I have been consistently doing every month all year and previously it has been granted every month…NOT for November though because of the new rule of you removing single days off.
"I requested for 4 days off, I’ve got 4 AVLs instead"
I was granted a week of leave that was not put on my roster so I had to contact my manager to get the shifts removed
I was rostered zero shifts even though I nominated to work.
I’m getting boc and late duties that I never bid for.
"I’m not, my roster predominantly lates, I want early duties please. I have changed bids again to HOPEFULLY achieve more earlies."
I’ve been bidding for trips for the past few months and I’ve gotten 0
I’ve given up on bids
"Im late prefer and I get lots of morning, this is not good"
It is the worst roster I have had since returning to Narrow Body
its hard to get what I bid of
It's not what I bid for at all so pretty unhappy. I bid for 2 sectors and I got mostly 4 sectors.
"Jbid has not worked for so many people over so many months  What’s the point of asking for days off and not getting them , you might as well not request them"
Jnis is useless for CMs.
Keep getting rostered shifts that are not within my bids. Morning preferred and rostered lates. 2 out of 5 day off requests granted.
Literally bid for 2 days off. No dice as usual.
Minimum bidding satisfaction achieved as most duties are opposite to what was requested and day off requests rendered pointless as the string of days off are broken up with duties. An early standby followed by an afternoon duty - OFF day plans ruined
"Months ago requested highest priority 2 days together and rostered GT4 on 2nd day on unpublished, emailed training to change and no reply. Highest priority 2 days before holiday and didn’t get. Also rostered morning domestic AVL and PM preference."
My bids have not changed since June last year  For some reason this month all I got were 5am sign ons
my days of were achieved but not my duty bid and it always seems like one or the other when it comes to the bids
My highest bid for trips continues to not be met
My highest bid of a day off was not achieved
My highest bid of a weekend off I didn’t get. Too many day shifts and not enough trips
"My highest bid was a day off however I was rostered x4 AVLs with the last one being on the day I bidded to have off, making it extremely difficult to adjust. I also bidded for early duties however received many lates instead."
My highest bid was for trips and I did not get a single one.
My preference is late and I got early and BOC??  Some crew preference BOC but didn't get any or early crew got some late shifts which is they can't do.
My request for SIN was allocated then changed by WFP on publication.
Negative satisfaction as cabin crew we rely on consistency and reliability. Unfortunately JBid is continually falling short.
Never get days off requests fulfilled and so hard to swap out of duties. The Pairings are fatiguing and BNE needs more trips for those who want them to break it up abit
Never got one
Never got what i have bid for
No
No BOCS. I bedded for BOCS and 2 sectors
No DPS and too many AKL
No duties received.
No flights on JQ141
No highest bids realised. Changed training requirements to open things up for the bids. Still nothing.
No improvement
"No matter what you bid you never get it, this system is total bull crap"
No NRT or KIX trip given. Only 1 KIX was assigned as I am training. No requested day off given.
No preferences
No trips even though I bid for them and still get 4 sectors even though I bid for 2
None of my bidding was achieved.
None of the bid granted
None of the bids are acheived
"not at all, as I did not receive the vast majority of my bids"
Not enough shifts
Not getting my highest requests
Not getting preference bids
Not getting what I bid for in days off or type of flying.  Training Captains are getting all 2 sector earlys and weekends.
not happy
Not happy - bidded for mornings
"Not happy at all, all my primary trip bids are ignored."
Not one bid granted
Not satisfied at all
Not satisfied at all.
"October, I requested AM duties and was given AM duties.  November JBid preferences remained exactly the same as October and for November  I’m rostered all Late duties. It is clear that Adhoc CM’s destroy permanent CM roster requests."
"Once again I am getting the opposite to what I bid for, even after following the advice from the Jbid experts"
"One out of four bids, making it very hard to have any life outside of work  what so ever."
"Only achieved 4 out of all my bids, not many trips were given considering I mainly bidded for trips, too many 4 sectors and an avalon duty when Tullamarine is my preferred base."
Only one duty that fell within my bid parameters
Perth balisr eturns  with little rests in between causes fatigue.
"Priority bids all ignored,"
Received 0 duties that represent my highest bid
Received all 4 sector days when I specifically requested 2 sectors
Requested 1 day off on a week day a been sent on a trip.
"Requested 2 days off out for 31, and didn’t get these days off. Instead I got a BOC and I request morning duties"
"Requested to finish before 130pm All four sectors, I requested tsv etc"
"Requests not allocated, three trips with 0 requested, all early standbys with PM set as preference. Two 3am standbys directly before simulator"
Rostered 13 afterrnoon duties as mornings preferred and more long 4 sectors than usual
Sad
Same as above example
"Same as the above answer, this months worse than last month with non preferred."
Same statement as above Highest none was achieved?? thought that at least bidding for highest was a priority so that crew can arrange their work life balance.
"See previous comment. Ideal shifts, but receiving less and less duties each month is consistently disappointing"
Single day off
Taken all preferences out and only requested 3 days off and for one of the single days off I'm sent to another base for 4 days. Not a great product
Terrible I only bit for mornings and have been given lates. I understand there are a lot of people but this is the only thing I bit for and I would like to have that.
Terrible. As above. The single trip I have been rostered is in my option a fatigue risk. I have requested a roster review from the RFM
"The bid didn't match even a single one. I bid several but it was one certain flight, didn't get one."
The days off I bided for were complete ignored. It’s totally unacceptable.
The outcome is totally opposite of my bidding.
This system is not working didn’t get my requests
Three HIGHEST REQUESTS. Again 3 HIGHEST requests of a Sunday Monday off have not been achieved. What a waste of highest bids and a waste of my time bidding. What’s the point of bidding when the roster I have looks like someone that hasn’t bid
too many 4 sectors and not within desired finish timeframe
"Too many requests denied, especially days off"
Trainers cannot bid.
Trip bids set up for many preferences but none satisfied
Unhappy
Unmet bids
Very disappointed.  I only got 1 requested Dey off got the month and it is my highest request.
Very unsatisfied because I don’t get what I ask for. Jbid keeps disappointing and no surprises also. Expert advise doesn’t help.
Waste of time as usual
We were getting blocks of days off that worked well.
"Well I got my requested 2 days off, but then I got 2 x 5am early shifts after it which doesn’t make sense as I am PM preferred as Global preference…"
What I have is all ICN I am a Japanese speaker tho
"What is the point of having a bid system if it clearly fails to deliver what it promises, or alludes to promising? You bid lates, you get earlies. It is a complete waste of time."
"While I bid for trips, to try to mitigate fatigue,  it now looks like trips are being paired to become  fatigue enducing."
Why is there any bid for day off if my bid is not granted at all? I am very disappointed with this month roster.
Worst Roster
Zero bid outcomes achieved. Outcomes emailed to baseops with no follow-up to date.
Zero bids achieved again
Zero bids achieved. No reason not to give me my 7 day block each month but again it was denied.
Zero day off bids granted and a very low achieved flight requests
"Zero Highest bid 5-9, 2 Medium bid 9-12"
"Zero success - out of base flying, too much paxing."
